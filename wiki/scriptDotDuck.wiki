The script.duck file is the core of your visual novel. You only have to modify it and put your ressources into the right folders, and let's go!

{{{
>init
}}}
The first thing you have to put to initialize the following parameters.

{{{
WINDOW_SIZE = "1000, 750"
}}}
The size of the window of the visual novel. If you leave it blank, you will have a 1000*750 pixel window.

{{{{
WINDOW_TITLE = "My Visual Novel"
}}}
The title of your window. Set it up, if not you will have a generic title...

{{{
WINDOW_ICON = ""
}}}
If you want something else than the superb duck-engine's duck.

{{{
BACKGROUND_TITLE = "graph/title.png"
}}}
The background of the title window. Interesting, because if you don't set it up, it won't work.

{{{
MUSIC_TITLE = "music/narcissu-theme.mp3"
}}}
And finally, the music of the title window. You can obviously leave it blank.

{{{
>caracters
}}}
You have to add _all_ the caracters that you will use during the visual novel. You can as much as you want. They will be saved in memory, and later you can use them.

{{{
>>HAPPY_MAN = "graph/perso/happy_man.png"
}}}
Use this exact syntax to add a caracter.

{{{
>scene
}}}
Now, you can finally script your scene. Don't forget to use this tag!

{{{
background = "graph/scene.jpg"
}}}
As for the title window, don't forget to set a background, if there is none, duck-engine will produce an error.

{{{
music = "music/narcissu-15cm.mp3"
}}}
Music of the scene. You can leave it blank as well as the music title.

_Note: obviously you can use "background" and "music" as much as you want, if there was music and background before they will be replaced._

{{{
show HAPPY_MAN "400, 400"
}}}
Use "show" ONLY with caracters you have defined before. The numbers correspond to the X and Y position of the caracter.

{{{
<Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit./>
}}}
This text will be show at screen.

{{{
>end
}}}
Finally, to tell duck-engine that your visual novel is finished!
