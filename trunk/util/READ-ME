Hello! Welcome to Duck-Engine pre-alpha. This is a simple Visual Novel engine.
You have a file named script.duck. Edit it following the syntax, put your
ressources in /graph for images, put your music in /music. Once everything is done,
just type make on a terminal. Wait for the compilation, and then you've got your VN.
Have fun!
